# 🚨esx_prisonalarm

## ℹ️Information
I was just a little bored. I looked around and saw that there is no such thing as yet.

So here it is. If strangers who are not imprisoned enter the prison, the alarm goes off.

I updated this resource. !!!I haven't testt it yet, so maybe it is working maybe not.
